    Purpose: This page displays the best coding practices in HTML,CSS and JS
    Users can click on the tick boxes and see if they are following the best practices or not 
    and also give them a summary at the end.
    
    This page uses local storage to remember which best practices the user has selected even after opening and closing the page
    Near this summary you should clearly state a simple criteria for "success" 
    (e.g. over 12/15 best practices met) and when the user has met that metric you should use
    an AJAX request to retrieve a random cute animal picture from a suitable public API 
    (e.g. from a service listed in "Animals" section of https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and display it to the user as a reward!
    Use Bootstrap-->
